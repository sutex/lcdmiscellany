Somewhere on this site http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=365706&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight=  is the original Dev who made this verison,  couldn't find it again

G19 keyboard with build in LCD screen was the best Idea Logitech have ever had .. 

Just wish they would re release a newer version..
