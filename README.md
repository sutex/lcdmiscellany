Been using lcdmiscellany on my G19 keyboard for years
It allows me too see uploads/ downloads speeds with coloured graph ( very cool)
Memory & vol levels 
Current internet IP addresss
Taskmanger , the ablitly to terminate programs via the LCD screen ( very handy)
Media control winamp itunes vlc, mpc
Calculator
Cut'n Paste , shows up in the LCD screen 
Rss feed
UTorrent 
Weather 


I hope that others who are playing Elite dangerous can see the potential of the G19 LCD display
